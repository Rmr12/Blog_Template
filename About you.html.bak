<p> I know a place <br>
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face<br>
We get married in our heads<br>
Something to do while we try to recall how we met<br>
<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you?<br>
<br>
You and I (don't let go) were alive (don't let go)<br>
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes<br>
Wait (don't let go) and pretend (don't let go)<br>
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end<br>
<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you?<br>
<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you?<br>
<br>
There was something 'bout you that now I can't remember<br>
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender<br>
And I miss you on a train, I miss you in the morning<br>
I never know what to think about<br>
<br>
I think about you (so don't let go)<br>
About you (so don't let go)<br>
Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you? (Don't let go)<br>
<br>
About you<br>
About you<br>
Do you think I have forgotten<br>
About you? (Don't let go)<br>
<br>
